2020-03-23,England,C1E_School closing,3,"On 2020-03-23, all schools in England (including private and sixth forms) were required to close except for children of key workers and vulnerable children. This matches OxCGRT guidance that such a policy is coded as 3 (require closing all levels), as confirmed by both the government press release and BBC News. High confidence; no ambiguity."
2020-06-01,England,C1E_School closing,2,"On 1 June 2020, England partially reopened schools for specific primary year groups (Reception, Year 1, Year 6) and priority groups, while the majority of students remained at home. This is supported by both the GOV.UK guidance and BBC News (24 May 2020), aligning with OxCGRT C1E_School closing guidelines for a score of 2: 'require closing (only some levels or categories)'."
2020-06-15,England,C1E_School closing,2,"Score 2 assigned because as of June 15, 2020, only specific primary year groups and limited secondary students (Year 10 and Year 12) were allowed some in-person attendance, with the majority of students still required to stay home (see GOV.UK, BBC). This directly matches the OxCGRT definition for a 2: 'require closing (only some levels or categories, eg just high school, or just public schools).' Validation approved, citing both official guidance and media coverage."
2020-07-02,England,C1E_School closing,2,"On 2 July 2020, strict school closures (score 3) were reintroduced in Leicester and some surrounding areas due to a COVID-19 outbreak, but the rest of England maintained partial openings (score 2). Per OxCGRT guidelines, the national score for England remains 2 with a targeted flag for Leicester at 3, as the full closure was not general across England. Sources: GOV.UK, Leicester City Council, BBC, OxCGRT codebook."
2020-07-15,England,C1E_School closing,2,"On 2020-07-15, England maintained partial school closure: only some primary and secondary year groups were allowed to attend in-person, with most students still at home. Full closure (score 3) was reimposed only in Leicester as a local measure per government statements and local sources. This matches OxCGRT guidance for score 2 nationally, with a targeted flag for Leicester. (Sources: GOV.UK, Leicester City Council, BBC News, OxCGRT guidelines, historical data)"
2020-09-01,England,C1E_School closing,1,"On 2020-09-01, schools in England reopened to all students for full-time education, but with significant operational changes such as social distancing, bubbles, staggered breaks, and enhanced cleaning. This aligns with OxCGRT guidelines for a score of 1 ('all schools open with significant differences compared to non-Covid-19 operations'). Source: official UK government press release."
2020-11-05,England,C1E_School closing,1,"On 2020-11-05, all schools, colleges, and universities in England remained open with significant operational changes (protective measures, altered operations) but no required closures. This matches OxCGRT C1 level 1. Source: GOV.UK national guidance, OxCGRT codebook, historical context."
2020-11-17,England,C1E_School closing,1,"On 2020-11-17, all schools, colleges, and universities in England remained open with significant protective measures in place (social distancing, bubbles, cleaning, etc.) as confirmed by official government guidance. This matches OxCGRT score 1: 'all schools open with alterations resulting in significant differences compared to non-Covid-19 operations.' No required closures at any level. (Source: gov.uk guidance, OxCGRT codebook, historical context)."
2020-11-30,England,C1E_School closing,1,"On 2020-11-30, a single school near Taunton closed due to a local Covid-19 outbreak, but the dominant government policy in England remained that all schools were open with significant operational differences (bubbles, social distancing, cleaning). Per OxCGRT guidelines, targeted/local closures do not raise the score above 1 unless there is a region- or category-wide closure. (Source: Somerset County Gazette, OxCGRT guidelines, recent historical data)"
2020-12-11,England,C1E_School closing,1,"On 2020-12-11, England's policy was for all schools to remain open with significant operational differences (social distancing, bubbles, mass testing, etc.), per both historical context and the Evening Standard article. The closure of Eton College was an isolated, outbreak-driven event, not a government-mandated or policy-driven closure. This decision and reasoning strictly follow OxCGRT guidelines, which state local/individual school closures do not change the overall score unless part of a higher-level government policy."
2021-01-05,England,C1E_School closing,3,"On 5 Jan 2021, England required the closure of all primary, secondary schools and most university teaching for the general public, allowing only vulnerable children and children of critical workers to attend in-person; all others learn remotely. This matches C1=3 per OxCGRT guidelines ('If only children of essential workers are allowed in schools, this is reported as a closure for the general public'; university exceptions for a narrow set of courses do not affect the closure status). Policy is national, not targeted. (Source: gov.uk 2021-01-05; OxCGRT guidelines)"
2021-03-08,England,C1E_School closing,1,"On 2021-03-08, all schools, colleges, and FE providers in England reopened to all students for face-to-face teaching, with significant operational changes such as twice-weekly testing and mask mandates (see FE Week, Sky News). Per OxCGRT guidelines, this constitutes 'all schools open with alterations resulting in significant differences compared to non-Covid-19 operations' (score 1, Table 5), marking a shift from previous national closure (score 3) to open with differences. Validator approved."
2021-05-17,England,C1E_School closing,1,"On 17 May 2021, all schools, colleges, and universities in England were open for face-to-face teaching, but with significant operational differences including rapid testing and social distancing. This matches OxCGRT guidelines for a score of 1 ('all schools open with alterations resulting in significant differences compared to non-Covid-19 operations'), as confirmed by official government guidance."
2022-01-04,England,C1E_School closing,1,"Schools in England were open but with significant operational differences (e.g., required/recommended face coverings for secondary students) per GOV.UK. This matches OxCGRT guidelines for score 1: 'all schools open with alterations resulting in significant differences compared to non-Covid-19 operations.' No evidence of closure or return to pre-pandemic operation."
2022-01-27,England,C1E_School closing,1,"On 2022-01-27, schools in England remained open with significant operational differences (such as testing and absences due to isolation) even as mask mandates for secondary school classrooms ended. This matches OxCGRT guidelines for a score of 1: 'all schools open with alterations resulting in significant differences compared to non-Covid-19 operations.' (BBC, 21 Jan 2022; OxCGRT codebook; historical summary)."
2022-02-24,England,C1E_School closing,0,"On 24 Feb 2022, all Covid operational restrictions in English schools were lifted (no required testing, masks, or isolation); schools were open and operating as in pre-Covid times. This fits OxCGRT guidelines for level 0 (no measures), as supported by BBC reporting and the delineation between level 0 and 1 in the official codebook."
